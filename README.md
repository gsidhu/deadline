# deadline
Meet your deadline.

Vanilla JS version: [`index.html`](./index.html)
Svelte version: [deadline-svelte](./deadline-svelte/)

To do:
- add "show more" if > two rows of months on desktop or > 4 months on mobile

Feel free to use this code as you like. This is my first ever Svelte project - I loved it!
